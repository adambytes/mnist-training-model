This script creates a simple CNN with two convolutional layers, followed by ReLU activations and max pooling, and a fully connected layer for classification. It uses the cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimization algorithm. The model is then trained for a number of epochs, where one epoch is a single pass through the entire training dataset.
